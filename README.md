## About The Project
Recipe merupakan website untuk eksplorasi tentang berbagai resep makanan, selain itu user juga bisa berbagi resep yang sudah dibuat agar bisa dilihat banyak orang. pengguna juga bisa menandai resep yang disukai dan ingin disimpan jika ingin melihat resep tersebut di lain waktu.

## Usage
This website is built using [Vite + React](https://vitejs.dev/) the next-js framework. The web design and responsiveness are achieved with [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/). For API management, the website utilizes the [Axios Library](https://axios-http.com/) to ensure neatness and efficiency. The site employs [react-redux](https://react-redux.js.org/) for state management, making the state flow cleaner, more efficient, and easier to control. For routing, the website uses the [react-router-dom](https://reactrouter.com/en/main) library to simplify the routing process.
