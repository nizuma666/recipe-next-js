## About The Project
Recipe is a website for exploring various food recipes. Users can also share their own recipes for others to see. Additionally, users can mark recipes they like and save them to view later.

## Usage
This website is built using [Vite + React](https://vitejs.dev/), the next-js framework. The web design and responsiveness are achieved with [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/). For API management, the website utilizes the [Axios Library](https://axios-http.com/) to ensure neatness and efficiency. The site employs [react-redux](https://react-redux.js.org/) for state management, making the state flow cleaner, more efficient, and easier to control. For routing, the website uses the [react-router-dom](https://reactrouter.com/en/main) library to simplify the routing process. The website uses the `cookies-next` library to store tokens used for authentication in cookies.
